Some ideas for the documentation:
=================================
- Getting started page with installation and so on
- user guide: 
    - rough overview of how each state works 
    - input and output of each state
    - ```hsrb_mode```/```eth_mode```
    - How to add pose estimator
    - explanation of windows when doing gp and rv (and which topics are interesting)
- API reference:
    - more detailed description of each state
    - doc of each function
